This is a new iteration of the no-longer-maintained [R-Box](https://github.com/randy3k/R-Box) aiming to utilize the use
  of [language server](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver) + better support R Markdown + better support of R packaging + .....

## Installation

1. Install [`languageserver`](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver) from CRAN
```R
# install R package languageserver
install.packages("languageserver")
```

2. Install `R-IDE` and [`LSP`](https://github.com/tomv564/LSP) from Package Control


## Usage

- language features for R files

    Execute `LSP: Enable Language Server Globally` (or `In Project` if you are working with a project) in Command Palette and enable `rlang`. Upon successful execution, you should see a badge called `rlang` in the status bar.

- language features for C/C++ files
    
    `R-IDE` ultilizes [`ccls`](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) to provide language features for C/C++ files. Install `ccls` first. Then enable `ccls-r` server in LSP.

- R-IDE menu

    There is a R-IDE menu when an R project or an R file is opened. User could edit the setting `exec_items` to modify the menu.
